# Educational Platform
**Our platform is dedicated to educational
organizations like schools. As education doesn’t depend on the age of the student, our platform
doesn’t too.**

Teachers from all around the globe can sign themselves up on our platform, and they
encourage their students to download the game app so they can benefit from the platform.

Teachers add courses to the platform and supply their students with
the code of the course, then the student can see the course’s news, chapters, and they can
enter the game.

In the game, students have to watch the video, enter the maze, search for portals that have possible questions.
Answering 50% of the questions makes them qualified to move to the next lesson.
At that time a green portal will show up in a lost point of the maze they will have to look for it or finish answering the questions.

**What do we provide in our platform?**
In the meantime, we provide teachers a web-based admin panel, which they can use to
add their courses and news. here: http://janamath.com/

We also give students a fun way to learn from their teachers, the game application
starts with their information and the course they have enrolled in. Then they go directly to the
game after watching the lesson carefully. They will be lost in a maze and to get out of it they
should answer 50% of the course’s questions correctly, otherwise, they will be stuck in the
maze.

**What do we expect to provide in the future?**
We still lack resources, for example, our platform in the meantime can’t handle big
amount of teachers and courses on it, hence videos need to be uploaded somewhere. Also, our
databases can’t handle a huge amount of students with their information stored there.
What we intend to do is to start small. Like any start-up, after some time we will expand
our hosts to cope up with a larger amount of students and teachers with more courses.
Platform-wise we will track bugs daily, and add some features depending on the
feedback from users. Eventually, we will add more mazes to make the application less boring,
also we will add the ability to change the maze environment by the teacher to be suitable with
their courses and their targeted student’s ages.
