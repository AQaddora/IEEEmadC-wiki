## Short discription 
Example: Voluny is a quick, easy and simple volunteering app that is tailored specifically for volunteers who love to help out their community as well as to recruiters, who are seeking for volunteers for their organizations.

## Team:
Example: ## The Bay Area Team
We consist of 2 team members that make this wonderful app happen: Uyen Vicky Vo as the UIUX designer and [Marton Zeisler](https://github.com/Marton-Zeisler) as the programmer. We came up with the idea together and have been working hard on Voluny starting from scratch. We use Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch for UIUX designing and Xcode/Swift for developing. In addition, Firebase, Google APIs (Geocoding & Places API) was being used for the back-end development. 

If any instructions to run your app.
## Installation Guidelines
Example: ## Installation Guidelines
There are two ways to test Voluny:
 - This repository contains an executable .ipa file in the ipa folder. In order to install and run this file you need to have a jailbroken iPhone. Download the .ipa file using this link: [Download Voluny.ipa](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1zHikbY5PuwYGUCoc4V14TX5YO0BnkTfu)

 - Another way to install Voluny is by inviting me to an Apple developer account and allowing me to upload the application to Testflight. TestFlight is Apple's online service for testing mobile applications but it is only possible with paid Apple developer accounts. An Apple developer account costs 99 dollars per year.
